Goals
--------

I work in a company that specializes in access control systems and security equipment. My responsibilities include everything:  
* creating company websites
* SEO optimization
* web analytics
* copywriting
* creating banners in Photoshop  

and others.

The first big disadvantage of small companies is the lack of distribution of responsibilities.  

Secondly, all knowledge has to be taken from books and the Internet. There is no mentor, no one to learn from, it is difficult to control your mistakes.  

>I have chosen for myself a highly specialized field in which I want to become a real professional.
